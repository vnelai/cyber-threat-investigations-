This playbook outlines a structured process for analyzing and responding to suspected phishing emails. 
It‚Äôs designed for SOC analysts, IR teams, or personal use during threat investigations.

## üéØ Objectives

- Confirm whether the email is malicious
- Extract and enrich indicators (IP, domain, URL, attachments)
- Assess impact and scope
- Document findings and actions taken

## üß≠ Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Triage

| Task | Tool/Notes |
|------|------------|
| Check subject line and sender address | Look for spoofing, misspellings, urgency |
| View email headers | Use [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) for quick triage, then parse manually for deeper analysis |
| Extract links and attachments | Do not click ‚Äî extract safely | See below for how to do this üëá |
---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ IOC Extraction

| Indicator | How to Extract |
|-----------|----------------|
| URLs/domains | Hover over links or inspect HTML source |
| IP addresses | From `Received:` fields in email headers |
| File hashes | Use SHA256 hash generator (if attachments) |
| Email addresses | Sender, Reply-To, Return-Path |
| Attachment name| May hint at social engineering |
| URLs	| In the body (if any visible or behind images) |
| Phone # | ‚òéÔ∏è Phone number  |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis & Risk Assessment

| Question | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Is the sender spoofed or lookalike? | Check SPF/DKIM headers and domain age |
| Is the URL serving malware or credential phishing? | Use sandbox analysis and screenshots |
| Is this a known campaign or APT tool? | Check community comments on VirusTotal |
| Does it target me specifically? | Look for personalization, internal context |

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Document & Report

| Action | Deliverable |
|--------|-------------|
| Summarize findings | `README.md` in project folder |
| List all IOCs | `iocs.md` file with enrichment results |
| Attach screenshots | Save in `screenshots/` folder |
| MITRE mapping | e.g., `T1566.001 ‚Äì Spearphishing Attachment` |
| Timeline or timeline notes | Optional: markdown table or JSON object |
