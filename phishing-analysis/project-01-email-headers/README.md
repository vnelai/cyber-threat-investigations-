# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Investigations

This repository is where I’m documenting my hands-on cybersecurity projects — from phishing analysis to threat enrichment and detection workflows.

I’m currently setting up the structure and preparing real investigations. Projects and write-ups will be added as I complete them.

Stay tuned — to be continued.
